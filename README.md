"I was here the hole time"
--
My name is Pedro, I'm 31 and I'm from Lisbon. I just started my coding journey 3 weeks ago and it seems that I found a passion! I'm taking a course in Udemy, from Jonas Schmedtmann, to learn Javascript! It'll be a long journey, but I want to make the most out of it! If you have any advice for a passionate begginer, feel free to share it!

Thank you all in advance!!

Cheers,
